## Real Estate Price Prediction

        This project explores the relationship between various factors—like house age, location, and nearby amenities—and the price per unit area of real estate. Using data analysis and machine
        learning, we predict house prices based on these features. Simple, effective, and insightful.

        Key Features:
            Data Analysis: Explored patterns and relationships in the data using visualizations.
            Visualization: Created scatter plots, histograms, and a correlation matrix to highlight key insights.
            Prediction Model: Used Linear Regression to predict house prices.

        Here’s what happens step-by-step:

            Data Exploration:

                Used histograms to study the distribution of variables like house age, MRT station distance, and convenience stores.
                Created scatter plots to understand how these features relate to house prices.
                Built a correlation matrix to identify strong relationships.

            Feature Selection:

                Focused on features like:
                    Distance to MRT station
                    Number of convenience stores
                    Latitude and Longitude

            Modeling with Linear Regression:

                What is Linear Regression?
                    A method to predict a target value by finding the best-fitting line through the data.
                    It’s simple yet effective for understanding relationships between variables.

                Why Linear Regression?
                    Ideal for this problem due to its interpretability and suitability for predicting continuous values like prices.


            Prediction and Visualization:

                Compared actual vs. predicted prices using scatter plots to evaluate the model's performance.

            Skills Used:
                Data Analysis and Visualization:
                    Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to clean and explore data.

                Machine Learning:
                    Scikit-learn to split data, train the model, and evaluate performance.

                Linear Regression:
                    For making predictions and understanding feature influence.
